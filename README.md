**Going back from where we started.**  
In this paper the authors have shown that while convolutions(CNNs) and attention(Vision Transformers) are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. 

The idea behind the Mixer architecture is to clearly separate 
- the per-location (channel-mixing) operations and
- cross-location or per-features (token-mixing) operations.

Both operations are implemented with MLPs.

## Architecture

</p>

MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to
image patches (i.e. “mixing” the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. “mixing” spatial information).

MLP-Mixer consists of per-patch linear embeddings, Mixer layers, and a classifier head. Mixer layers contain one token-mixing MLP and one channel-mixing MLP, each consisting of two fully-connected layers and a GELU nonlinearity. 

Other components include: skip-connections, dropout, layer norm on the channels, and linear classifier head.

The Mixer layer can be written as follows in matrix multiplication form:

Here σ is an element-wise nonlinearity (GELU).
